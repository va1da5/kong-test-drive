# Kong API Gateway Test Drive

This repository contains files after a test drive of [Kong API gateway](https://konghq.com/community/). It was meant to better understand the available capabilities and functionality. The current setup uses declarative configuration that does not allow configuring Kong over administrative API (does not use database).

## Getting Started

```bash
# start services
make up

# stop services and clean environment
make down

# restart Kong after configuration updates
make restart-kong
```
